# Compiler Phases Implementation: Lexical and Syntax Analysis

Welcome to Group 6 repository for the CPT316 assignment on implementing the lexical and syntax analysis phases of a compiler. 

## Instructions to Run

1. **Clone the repository**: `git clone https://github.com/ahdeanlau/CPT316_Assignment_1`.
2. **Navigate to the source directory**: `cd CPT316_Assignment_1`.
3. **Run the program**: `python parse_code.py`

### Displaying the AST

1. Open the generated `syntax_tree.dot` file.
2. Copy the contents of the file.
3. Paste the contents into the [Graphviz Online Editor](https://edotor.net/).

## Objective

This project aims to:
1. Provide hands-on experience in implementing the lexical and syntax analysis phases of a compiler.
2. Understand the role of these phases in parsing source code and generating an abstract syntax tree (AST).
3. Enhance our problem-solving and coding skills in building a functional compiler component.
4. Document our implementation to make it clear and comprehensible for others.
