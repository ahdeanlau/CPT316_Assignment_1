# Compiler Phases Implementation: Lexical and Syntax Analysis

Welcome to our group's repository for the CPT316 assignment on implementing the lexical and syntax analysis phases of a compiler. 

## Objective

This project aims to:
1. Provide hands-on experience in implementing the lexical and syntax analysis phases of a compiler.
2. Understand the role of these phases in parsing source code and generating an abstract syntax tree (AST).
3. Enhance our problem-solving and coding skills in building a functional compiler component.
4. Document our implementation to make it clear and comprehensible for others.

## Assignment Guide

### 1. Language Selection

For this assignment, a simple programming language or domain-specific language (DSL) will be chosen. The language will be basic but expressive enough to demonstrate the implementation of lexical and syntax analysis.

### 2. Lexical Analysis

We will implement the lexical analysis phase, which involves tokenizing the source code and generating a sequence of tokens. This phase will encompass creating regular expressions and finite automata to recognize keywords, identifiers, literals, and other language constructs.

### 3. Syntax Analysis

Our focus will then shift to the syntax analysis phase, where we will parse the token stream generated by the lexical analysis. A parser will be implemented, which could be a recursive descent or using a parser generator like Bison or ANTLR. This phase's ultimate goal is to generate an abstract syntax tree (AST).

### 4. Testing and Validation

A comprehensive set of test cases will be developed to validate our compiler's lexical and syntax analysis. It's essential for our compiler to handle correct code efficiently and provide informative error messages for incorrect code.

### 5. Documentation

Our team will ensure thorough documentation of the implementation. We aim to provide clear and concise explanations of our code, detailing how lexical and syntax analysis are executed in our compiler. Code comments and further explanations will be inclusive.

### 6. Demo and Presentation

A demonstration or presentation is prepared to showcase our compiler phases. We will explain our design choices and the specific language implemented for this purpose.
